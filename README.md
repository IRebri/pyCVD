## Citation
If you are publishing scientific results and this suite somehow was helpful, mentioning/citing some of our [articles](https://scholar.google.ru/citations?user=Q8aiUDQAAAAJ&hl=en) will be very nice and highly appreciated. Since 2017 almost all carbon materials discribed in this papers were produced by using plasma CVD system controlled by this pyCVD. Thank you for good scientific practice
